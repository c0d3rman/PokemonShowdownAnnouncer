# PokemonShowdownAnnouncer
This Chrome extension adds the Pokemon Stadium 2 announcer into Pokemon Showdown.

Currently, only a subset of announcements are supported, including moves and Pokemon names. If there is interest, in the future more could be added, such as general battle commentary and smarter logic to avoid repeating the same announcement or saying too many things at once.
